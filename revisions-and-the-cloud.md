# Revisions and the Cloud

We use git for version control of our code. This way, we can track changes, have snapshots of our work, and collaborate effectively with others. 

## Notes

### Flow

To commit and push:
> git status
> git add .
- This command adds all the files with any changes to the commit
> git commit -m "my commit message:
> git push origin main

To pull from remote repo:
> git pull 
- will fetch and merge remote changes
