# Programming with JavaScript

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Computers run top to bottom, left to right.

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

## Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

## Operators

Operators do something with operands. 

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

Operator
> `+`	Addition
> `-`	Subtraction
> `*`	Multiplication
> `**`	Exponentiation (ES2016)
> `/`	Division
> `%`	Modulus (Division Remainder)
> `++`	Increment
> `--`	Decrement

## Things I want to Know More About
I want to read other code bases and look for the use of operands to try to understand what an expression is doing, or evaluates to.
