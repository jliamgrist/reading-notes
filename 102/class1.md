# The Coder's Computer

A developer's computer is an important tool for their work. Many developers today even invest in very specific mechanical keyboards just to get the right "feel" from their workspace. 

There are other important elements of a good workspace, within ones computer:

* An IDE you are familiar with
    * This IDE should have the ability to highlight syntax, use extensions, and easily navigate files
* An opperating system you are comfortable with
    * With sufficient memory (RAM) for your projects
* A smooth integration with GitHub or Gitlab    

The differnece between an IDE and a text editor is that a text editor is a WYSIWYG while and IDE can be much more effective at managing and visualizing code.
