# HTML

We use HTML to structure websites and content. 

## Notes

### Basic Wireframe Structure of Content

> `<header>`

> `<main>`

> `<footer>`

All content goes inside the `<body>` tag

Draft a wireframe first!

- use google drawings to draft html
- use Adobe XD or Figma to design visual mockup
- then code

It is important to understand the user experience/flow before starting to design the visual mockups of the pages

## What I'd like to learn more about

- so each page is it's own html file, and they somehow pull from other javascript files. How do I insert javascript?
