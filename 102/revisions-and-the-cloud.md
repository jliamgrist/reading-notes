# Revisions and the Cloud

We use git for version control of our code. This way, we can track changes, have snapshots of our work, and collaborate effectively with others. 

## Notes

### Commit Flow

**To commit and push:**

> git status
> git add .

> - This command adds all the files with any changes to the commit

> git commit -m "my commit message:
> git push origin main

**To clone a remote repo**

> git clone https://github.com/link-to-repo

**To pull from remote repo**

> git pull s

> - This will fetch and merge remote changes

Collaboration using GitHub requires the use of creating and managing Pull Requests. 
Collaboration Workflow: 
Create a topic branch from master

- Commit changes for the project
- Push the topic branch to the GitHub project.
- Open a Pull Request.
- Confer with team and perform additional commits, if applicable.
- The project owner closes or merges the Pull Request.

## What I'd like to learn more about

- In a company setting, I can imagine that just managing the repo and all the pull requests is a big job. What is this job like? What is that carreer title?
- Can the state censor a GitHub repo? 
- What makes GitLab different?
