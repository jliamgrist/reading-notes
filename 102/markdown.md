# Basic Syntax


Markdown is a programming language that is easy and matters because it is often used to communicate effectively within the tech industry. 

## Here are some notes, how to use markdown

- To create a header, use the (`#`) symbol before text.
- To add a break in the text, use (`<br>`) after a line of text. 
- To make text bold, use two astericks (`**bold text**`)
- To make block text, use (`>`)

> These notes are summarized from [github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Things I want to know more about
- I want to practice some more *advanced markdown syntax features*.
- I want to understand differences when using HTML &amp; Markup. 

## How I began to learn markdown...

When working on a project with some developers, I noticed they were able to manipulate text styling, within cards on our project board (Atlassan). Now I'm seeing how it's really done!
