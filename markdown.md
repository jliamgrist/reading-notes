# Basic Syntax


Markdown is a programming language that is easy and matters because it is often used to communicate effectively within the tech industry. 

## Here are some notes, how to use markdown

- To create a header, use the (#) symbol before text.
- To add a break in the text, use (`<br>`) after a line of text. 
- To make text bold, use two astericks (**bold text*)
- To make block text, use (>)
