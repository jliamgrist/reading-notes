# Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML

List are useful to clearly separate information by line, using bulltet points or other symbols. You can change the symbol by setting the attribute. 

+ `<ul>` element is good for grouping a collection of items which does not have a necessary order.

+ `<ol>` element helps to group items in an ordered list, buy number.

## CSS

The CSS properties of margin and padding help place content in the right view level of the DOM. 

+ The *margin* property is like border patrol security, guarding the edge of the frame. 
+ The *padding* property is like a mother, carressing her children - the content tighly or loosly within her holdings. 

Everything in CSS has a box around it. Boxes have an inner display and an outer display type. 

+ Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

+ Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

+ Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

+ Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## JS

+ You can store any data type inside an array, including other arrays or objects. 
+ To point to a value of an array, you can use the location of the outer array, followed by the index location of the inner array, using brackets

### Operators:

Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()

### Booleans
If a boolean with the value of false is combined with another value, the combined value will be assigned a boolean value of "false".

### Loops
When a user is not authenticated yet, a loop can be used to check their level of permission and proceed to unlock features if necessary.
